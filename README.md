# How to set up the back-end

Make sure you've set up your IDE as described [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xJixS9IerS-gTzfc_bQKVrhL-7vPqZUttulOs9zADTE/edit#)!

## Installation

### Setting up the environment variables


## Starting and stopping the server
Open the terminal in VS Code and run `npm install` to install the dependencies. After this is completed, you should be able to run the server `npm run dev`. Remember that before closing VS Code, you should stop the server by pressing <kbd>Ctr+C</kbd> and by pressing <kbd>Y</kbd> and <kbd>Enter</kbd>. In case you forgot this, you can also kill all Node.js processes in your task manager.

To test if the server is properly running, navigate to [http://localhost:5000/api/swagger-ui](http://localhost:5000/api/swagger-ui).
